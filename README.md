# Web3 Todo List App ðŸ’»

## Description 

This project was made to start creating Dapps on Blockchain. In this case, the Ethereum testnet was used to use test Ether to deploy the smart contracts. 

The reason for creating a Todo-App is because it is the easiest to start with before doing more complex projects.





## Deployment ðŸš€

You need to have Node.js and Truffle on your PC

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  truffle console
```

To enable the smart-contract, you need to have Truffle open
```bash
  truffle migrate
```
In other console
```bash
  npm run dev
```
Then you go to the localhost, I recommend you use a wallet with test funds (ethers) you can get one from Truffle using the private key and importing it into a wallet like Metamask ðŸ¦Š
